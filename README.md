OINP Announcement Tracker
===================

Ontario Immigration Nominee Program (OINP) Master's Graduate Stream only accepts a very small number of applicants every year. This leads to the application quota being filled only hours after the applications are open.

This script is written to track the announcements page and send emails when an update is published on the relevant government website. It is intended to be called by a cron job. The recommended period is 5 minutes.

Please note that the government website where these announcements are published changes every year; therefore the relevant links need to be updated accordingly.
